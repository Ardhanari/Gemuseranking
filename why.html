                The content of this site doesn’t necessarily have to make sense. After all it’s a subjective ranking of vegetables, who could have thought that’s what is missing from the internet?  
                
                Layout was intended to resemble an elusive “Italian bistro menu” style. It was hard to achieve without using some crazy typography but I hope it at least gets a bit of that style. 
                The page is not mobile friendly, nor accessible because these aspects weren’t in the scope of the assignment! 
                My broken German is a result of a feeling “Not Enough Practice”. I’m currently somewhere in the middle of A2 level, so please excuse wonkiness.
